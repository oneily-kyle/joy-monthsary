    <h2>Happy 6th Monthsary, my love 💌</h2>
    <p>Every moment with you is a gift I’ll always treasure. These past two months of finally being by your side felt like a dream come true. After all the calls, messages, and longing, finally holding you, laughing with you, and simply being with you felt like home.</p>
    <p>Now that we’re back to being apart, and even farther than before, it hurts. But I carry the warmth of our time together in my heart. I want you to know how much I appreciate everything you did while we were together. Your presence, your effort, your love. You made me feel seen, safe, and deeply loved.</p>
    <p>Even from a distance, I’ll always be here for you. No matter how many miles are between us, I’ll support you, believe in you, and cheer you on as you chase your dreams. You're never alone. I’ll be your constant, your quiet strength whenever you need me.</p>
    <p>And while we wait for our next hello, I’ll keep wishing for the day I can see your smile again in person. That day will come, and I’ll be counting every one until then.</p>
    <p>Happy 6th, my love. Thank you for loving me the way you do.</p>
    <p>Always yours,<br>Kyle</p>
